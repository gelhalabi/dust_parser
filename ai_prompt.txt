Dust Sensor Monitoring Project - Session Starting Point

PROJECT OVERVIEW
This is a Python-based verification tool for monitoring two dust sensors located at 2m and 24m heights. The tool connects to sensors at 10.40.200.32:50003, reads real-time particle measurement data, and displays formatted results with particle size context.

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
- Working Python async implementation with Telnet connection
- Successfully parsing CSV-style data format with particle size context
- Clean, focused data display showing raw and parsed readings
- YAML-based configuration
- Basic error handling and logging

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
1. Network Configuration:
   - Host: 10.40.200.32
   - Port: 50003
   - Protocol: TCP/Telnet
   - Timeout: 10 seconds
   - Read interval: 1.0 seconds

2. Data Format:
   - CSV-style format with 18 fields:
     * Date (YY/MM/DD)
     * Time (HH:MM:SS)
     * MT1 readings (8 values)
     * MT2 readings (8 values)
   - Example: "25/05/07,22:46:35,MT1 191,MT1 21,...,MT2 150,MT2 20,..."

3. Particle Size Ranges:
   P1: ≥ 0.3 µm
   P2: ≥ 0.5 µm
   P3: ≥ 0.7 µm
   P4: ≥ 1.0 µm
   P5: ≥ 2.0 µm
   P6: ≥ 3.0 µm
   P7: ≥ 5.0 µm
   P8: ≥ 10.0 µm

4. Key Components:
   - SensorClient: Handles async network communication
   - DataParser: Processes raw data with particle size context
   - YAML configuration for sensor and logging settings
   - Display format shows both raw data and parsed readings with size ranges

LAST IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE (May 7, 2025):
- Added particle size context to readings (0.3µm to 10.0µm ranges)
- Removed average calculations for cleaner output
- Improved data display format
- Verified proper connection to both sensor heights

PRIORITY TASKS
1. Data Logging:
   - Implement file-based logging of sensor readings
   - Add data validation rules
   - Consider CSV export for historical analysis

2. Analysis Features:
   - Add particle distribution analysis
   - Implement size-specific thresholds
   - Consider real-time visualization

3. System Integration:
   - Plan EMF DCS system integration
   - Add data export capabilities
   - Implement graceful shutdown handling

CODING GUIDELINES
1. Keep implementations simple and focused
2. Show errors directly - no silent failures
3. Remove deprecated code immediately
4. Document new data patterns
5. Maintain clear data display formatting

This verification tool ensures dust sensors transmit valid data before EMF DCS system integration. Development should focus on reliability and clear data presentation while maintaining the tool's verification purpose.
